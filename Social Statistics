when calculating death rates, crime, marketing are some of the things that statistics can be found in. People today beleive that statistics are merely focus on numerical values, and many others also beleive that it was socially constructed, which is to say that it would have been performed and calculated by people. This is something that can be sometimes proven with the data there is. People do not understand that statistics are vulnerable to social construction.
